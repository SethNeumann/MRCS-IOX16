MRCS-IOX16 

The IOX16 provides an 16 additonal lines of i/o for the cpNode using the MCP23017 chip.
IOX16 lines are configurable in as input or output in 8 bit (1 byte) increments.
Up to 128 lines of i/o may be added to a cpNode in any combination of IOX16s and IOX32s for a total of 144 lines of i/o.
Input and output voltages are limited to 5V.
Each output may sink up to 25 mA subject to a device limit of 160mA, if all lines are used as output use 10mA as a design limit.
Since the vast majority of outputs in a model railroad signaling system are used for driving LEDS, 10mA should be adequate.
If you need to work with higher voltages or currents, use the CSNK adapter in conjunction with the IOX16.
Pads for inserting limiting resistors are provided for each line.
Output pads are spaced at 0.100" to allow you maximum flexibility in configuring outputs.
